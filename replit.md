# Library Management System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive, responsive Library Management System built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to manage all library operations, including member and book tracking, fee and expense management, and detailed analytics, all within a single-page application. The system utilizes LocalStorage for data persistence and features a modern golden-yellow theme. The business vision is to provide an accessible, no-backend solution for small to medium-sized libraries, offering a robust set of features for efficient library administration.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system employs a modern, professional golden-yellow theme with a responsive design, featuring a mobile-responsive hamburger navigation and a fixed sidebar for desktop. It includes a dark/light theme toggle with preference persistence, preference cards, professional toggle switches, and smooth animations/transitions for an enhanced user experience.

### Technical Implementations
The system is implemented as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using:
-   **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: For custom theming, responsive layouts, and animations.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all core business logic and dynamic content.
-   **Chart.js**: Integrated for data visualization.
-   **LocalStorage API**: Used for client-side data persistence, enabling offline functionality.

### Feature Specifications
The system encompasses several core features:
-   **Authentication**: Admin login with session management and password change.
-   **Member Management**: CRUD operations including seat assignment, membership types, status tracking (active/inactive), multi-month advance payments, CSV export, and cascade deletion. Features include half-day/full-day admission types with real-time check-in/check-out status, secure camera capture/upload for photos and ID proofs (stored via Telegram reference only), and professional multi-page PDF generation for member details, ID proof, and photo.
-   **Seat Management**: Visual grid layout with color-coded statuses, bulk additions, safe removal, and real-time statistics.
-   **Book Management**: CRUD for books, issue/return, overdue tracking, and stock alerts.
